# title
Like A Knife Through Clutter. 

# short description 
App intended to help users declutter unwanted items from their home through assisting them with organization, motivation, and advice

# Overview
The purpose of this program is to help people in Auckland New Zealand who are struggling to declutter there space, this could be people who have a little bit of junk or complete hoarders who are seriously impacted by their items.   I want this program to appeal to a large group of people in order to help the most people it can.   I was motivated to complete this project because of my grandparents who suffer from hoarding tendencies, I wish that a program like mine can help them with their problems.
